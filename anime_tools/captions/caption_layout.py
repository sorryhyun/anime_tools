"""What a caption claims about its own layout — counts, panels, candidacy.

The text-only prefilter for the position-clause pipeline and the multiview
audit: how many bindable subjects the caption claims, whether it describes one
character drawn several times (``multiple views`` / a comic page), and whether
it is worth running a detector over at all. Pure stdlib — no model, no pixels.

Every function here takes a caption *or* an already-parsed one
(:func:`~anime_tools.captions.position_clauses.as_parsed`), because a caller
asks several of them about the same caption in a row: ``is_candidate`` asks
three and ``propose_for_image`` five more, and each one parsing the string for
itself is the same parse over and over.
