"""What an image is *made of* — every file an exclusion has to move. Torch-free.

One function per live tree, each matching on directory + stem rather than on the
rel itself, because resize re-encodes (``a.jpg`` → ``a.png``) and each tree
spells the tail its own way (``a.txt``, ``a_mask.png``, ``a.ocr.txt``). The
per-tree lookups are deliberately the same ones the readers use, so an exclusion
cannot miss a file a stage would still find.

:func:`artifacts` is the answer the move engine (:mod:`._move`) walks.
