"""The exclusion ledger — the state an exclusion *is*. Torch-free.

**The ledger is the state.** Every stage but ``resize`` walks
``workspace/resized/``, so an image whose resized copy has left that tree is
already invisible to all of them — but ``resize`` would put it straight back on
the next preflight, which is why it reads :func:`excluded_rels` and adds them to
its own ``--skip``. That one chokepoint is the whole enforcement; nothing else
has to know.

The ledger is keyed by the image's path relative to the **source** tree
(``char_aki/a.jpg``), which is what ``resize``'s ``--skip`` names and what a
sidebar row is — :func:`rel_key` is the one spelling of that key. The files it
records are keyed by directory + stem instead (:mod:`._artifacts`), because
resize re-encodes (``a.jpg`` → ``a.png``) and each tree spells the tail its own
way.
