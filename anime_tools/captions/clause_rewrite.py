"""v2's move rules: which flat-bag tags a clause has earned the right to take.

The rewrite half of the position-clause pipeline. v1 was additive (a tag stayed
in the bag *and* appeared in its clause); v2 **moves** an attributable tag so
each attribute is asserted exactly once — the hand-written convention. This
module owns the five rules that bound a move and the report of what they
blocked; :mod:`anime_tools.captions.clause_vocabulary` decides what may enter a
clause in the first place, and
:mod:`anime_tools.stages.position_captions` drives both over the dataset.

Text and scores only — no pixels, no model. Per-rule evidence lives in
``docs/experimental/position_captions.md``.
