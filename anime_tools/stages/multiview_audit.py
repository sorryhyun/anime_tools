"""Find images that draw one character several times but are captioned ``1girl``.

The blind spot this closes: :func:`anime_tools.captions.caption_layout.is_candidate`
skips any caption whose girls-count is 1 and which carries no ``LAYOUT_TAGS``
member, so a sheet that *is* ``multiple views`` but was never tagged as one never
reaches detection at all. Worse, if it did, the missing layout tag would flip
:func:`is_repeated_subject_layout` to ``False`` and the clause writer would bind
the character's name and view-invariant traits per view — asserting the same girl
as two girls.

So this is an audit over the complement set: every image ``caption-position``
throws away as ``single-subject``. Two boxes where the caption claims one girl is
the finding; three signals then argue about what it means, and a verdict needs
two of them to agree before ``--apply`` will write it:

1. **Identity agreement** across the per-instance crops (hair / eye / hairstyle,
   plus the character name). Agreeing crops are one girl drawn twice; disagreeing
   crops are a character the caption never counted. This is the only signal that
   separates those two answers — but it goes silent on a headless close-up, which
   is why it can't be the only one.
2. **The whole-image ``multiple views`` head**, which needs no crop to be legible
   and is the fallback when (1) has nothing to say.
3. **The people-count head** insisting on ``1girl`` while the geometry sees
   several bodies — the view-sheet signature stated from the other direction.

Detection differs from the clause pipeline in one deliberate way: the escalation
target is forced to ``min_instances`` (2) rather than the caption's count, so the
low-threshold retry and the body-part fallback actually fire. Gating them on the
caption's ``expected=1`` would stop the search the moment one box was found,
which is precisely the image we are trying to catch. Signal (2) also runs on
every audited image, so a sheet whose views SAM merged into a single box still
surfaces — flagged ``tagger-only`` and never better than ``weak``.

Read-only apart from :func:`apply_findings`.
