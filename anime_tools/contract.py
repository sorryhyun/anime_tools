"""The constants both halves of the seam spell: this package's CLIs and GUI, and
the trainer (``anima_lora``) that shells out to them.

**Stdlib only.** Nothing here imports another ``anime_tools`` module, so the GUI
server, the resident autotag worker's driver and the trainer can all read it
without pulling a stage (and its torch) into their process. Pinned by
``tests/test_boundary.py::test_contract_is_torch_free``.

Everything below is part of the CLI/stdio surface a consumer was written
against. That surface is append-only within one :data:`CONTRACT_VERSION`; a
removed or renamed name bumps it, and the trainer asserts the version it
expects.
