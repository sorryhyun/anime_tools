"""Positional caption clauses — parse / compose / position vocabulary.

The dataset's hand-written convention binds attributes to subjects via trailing
clauses appended to the flat tag bag::

    safe, 3girls, akita neru, ..., white socks. On the left, akita neru,
    yellow eyes. On the middle, hatsune miku, twintails. On the right,
    kasane teto.

GOTCHA: the **period** is the clause delimiter; commas separate tags *within* a
segment. A naive ``caption.split(",")`` glues the header onto the previous tag
(``"white socks. On the left"``), silently shredding every clause a downstream
``tag.startswith("On the ")`` check relies on.

Pure stdlib by design (no torch, no model): the caption-variant generator, the
order-correction pass, and the auto-caption pipeline all parse clauses through
here so the three can't drift.
