"""Previous versions of one caption — the ``{stem}.history.txt`` sidecar.

Every write pushes the text it replaced here, oldest first, and the GUI's
caption ladder expands them into one badge apiece (``revised@1``,
``revised@2`` …). It uses :mod:`anime_tools.captions._sidecar`'s format; what is
local is the vocabulary — a record is a superseded caption, carrying a sequence,
a moment and a hand — and the fact that a file with no entries left is deleted
rather than written empty. The sidecar sits beside the caption, so a writer
needs no second path.

Torch-free, stdlib-only, and import-light: :mod:`anime_tools.stages.replay`
imports it from inside a function.
