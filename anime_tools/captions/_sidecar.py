"""The tab-delimited caption sidecar format shared by ``.variants.txt`` and
``.history.txt``: a comment header, then one tab-delimited record per line.

Two rules live here rather than in both callers:

* **The multi-dot stem.** Sidecar names are built with ``with_name``, never
  ``with_suffix``, so ``a.b.png`` yields ``a.b.variants.txt``.
* **The hand-edit tolerance.** Readers skip blank lines, comment lines and any
  line with the wrong field count rather than raising, and strip ``\\r``; a
  damaged sidecar must cost the sidecar, never a run.

Stdlib-only on purpose: :mod:`anime_tools.stages.replay` must stay importable
without :mod:`anime_tools.captions` behind it.
