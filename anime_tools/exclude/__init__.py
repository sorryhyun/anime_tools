"""Taking an image out of the pipeline, and putting it back.

An exclusion is a curation decision, not a stage: no model, no report, no diff to
agree to. It moves every file the image has out of the live workspace trees into
``workspace/_excluded/`` and writes down where each came from
(:data:`~anime_tools.workspace.EXCLUDED`); un-excluding moves them back.

| Half | What is in it |
|---|---|
| :mod:`._ledger` | the ledger — the state an exclusion *is*, and the rel that keys it |
| :mod:`._artifacts` | what an image is made of: every file that has to move |
| :mod:`._move` | the move engine — ``exclude_one`` / ``restore_one``, and the ``_many`` pair |
| :mod:`._cli` | ``python -m anime_tools.exclude`` |

The enforcement is one chokepoint: ``resize`` reads :func:`excluded_rels` into
its own ``--skip``, and every other stage walks ``workspace/resized/``, which an
excluded image has left. Torch-free.
