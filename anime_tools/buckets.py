"""Free-fit ("free-aspect token-band") resize geometry — the tier + bucket math.

Free-fit preserves an image's native aspect ratio and lands its patch-grid token
count anywhere inside its tier's band, so the cropped residual on the covering
axis is under one patch. Token count is ``(W//16) * (H//16)``.

Every number here must match the trainer's ``library/datasets/buckets.py``, or
the PNGs this package resizes get re-resized by ``make preprocess-resize``
instead of skipped.
