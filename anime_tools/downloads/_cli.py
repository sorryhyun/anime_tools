"""``python -m anime_tools.downloads`` — pre-fetch the weights, or list them.

A repair tool and a preflight, nothing more: every loader still auto-fetches on
first use, so this only moves the wait somewhere the user chose. One gated repo
failing must not abort the rest, which is why every failure is collected and
reported at the end rather than raised.
