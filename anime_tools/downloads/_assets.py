An :class:`Asset` is one model: where its files come from, where they land, and
an offline probe for whether they are already there. :meth:`Asset.fetch` is the
only thing here that touches the network, and every failure it raises is a
``FileNotFoundError`` naming the asset and the recovery rather than a hub
traceback — the GUI prints it straight into a job log.
