"""The text an image *contains* — the ``{stem}.ocr.txt`` sidecar.

A record names words that are in the picture, not a caption, so it lives in
:data:`anime_tools.workspace.OCR` — a tree of its own mirroring the resized tree
— rather than beside the caption. An OCR pass writes only there: no caption is
read or rewritten, so it needs no Apply gate and invalidates no TE cache.

A record is ``seq ⇥ box ⇥ det ⇥ score ⇥ text``, in reading order; the text is
last so it may contain tabs. ``det`` is the detector's confidence in the box,
``score`` the reader's confidence in the text (both ``0.000`` when nothing
stood behind them). There is no language column — the reader returns a string,
never a language. A pre-``det`` record (``seq ⇥ box ⇥ score ⇥ text``, four
fields) still reads, with ``det`` as ``0.0``.

The one place the record meets a caption is :func:`with_ocr_clause`, which
Export's ``--combine_ocr`` uses to publish the caption with the lines attached
as text clauses — speech, one per line said, as ``Japanese text reads as "…",
"…"`` and the sound effects, one per sound, as ``Japanese SFX reads as "…"``
(:mod:`anime_tools.captions.ocr_sfx`). Two floors decide which lines take
part (:func:`usable_lines`): the detector must have been sure of the box
(``det`` at or above :data:`DEFAULT_MIN_DET`; an unscored line — ``det``
``0.0``, a mask component or a pre-``det`` record — is not held to it), and
the glyphs must be big enough to be worth a caption at all
(:attr:`OcrLine.glyph_px` at or above :data:`DEFAULT_MIN_GLYPH`). The sidecar
keeps every line for a person to look at, the caption gets the ones worth
training on. The workspace caption is never rewritten, so the combine is a
property of the published tree.
