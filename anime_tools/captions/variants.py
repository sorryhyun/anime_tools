"""Caption-variant generation + on-disk variant sidecars (torch-free).

Two concerns live here, both deliberately free of any torch / model import so the
caption-correction step and the GUI can reuse them without dragging the heavy
deps into their process:

* :func:`generate_caption_variants` — the stochastic shuffle / tag-dropout /
  identity-randomize expansion used for train-time caption sampling. Extracted
  from ``text.py`` (which still re-exports it for backward-compat) so the
  preprocess *caption* step can materialize variants as text **before** the TE
  encoder is ever loaded.
* :func:`build_erasure_token_pool` — the dual-single erasure pool the
  identity-randomize axis draws from. Takes the two tokenizers as plain
  arguments (no torch), so the caption step can build it from a tokenizer-only
  load.
* the ``{stem}.variants.txt`` sidecar read/write pair — the combined,
  human-readable file that makes the generated variants the single source of
  truth: the caption step writes it, the TE step encodes exactly its lines, and
  the GUI previews it.

    (lexinvariant tag regularization, arXiv:2305.16349).

    A randomized slot is filled by a *different* pool token each draw, so the
    literal symbol stays unreliable — pushing the adapter to ground the concept
    in surrounding structure (image content + co-occurring tags) rather than the
    exact trigger vector (role-based, not vector-based, binding). Per the cited
    method the filler is a *real* vocab token, not gibberish: unreliability comes
    from the per-draw variation, not from the symbol being intrinsically
    meaningless. Distinct from tag-dropout (which removes the slot).

    **Dual-single** is the load-bearing constraint. Anima tokenizes captions
    twice — Qwen3 for the text encoder (``prompt_embeds``) *and* T5 for the LLM
    adapter's target ids (``crossattn_emb``). A filler must therefore be exactly
    one token in *both* vocabularies; otherwise it shreds into junk subword
    pieces on whichever side fragments it (random ASCII fragments in Qwen3; rare
    foreign tokens are clean in Qwen3 but explode in T5's English-centric
    sentencepiece). We pick lowercase ascii alphabetic words and keep only those
    that survive as a single token in both. ``exclude`` (the dataset's real tags)
    drops any word that is itself a genuine tag, so a filler is never mistakable
    for a true concept. Returns bare words (no leading space).

    Selection keys off the ``Ġ`` (leading-space) Qwen3 vocab form — exact for
    this token class (verified: heuristic == round-trip), so no Qwen3 re-encode

    v0 = pristine original caption. v1..v{N-1} are smart-shuffled (preserving

    is independently dropped with probability ``tag_dropout_rate``, then every
    surviving tag *after the prefix* has its identity erased (replaced by a fresh
    vocab token drawn from ``erasure_pool``) with probability
    ``tag_randomize_rate``. The ``@no-artist`` sentinel participates in the
    boundary but is stripped from every variant (including v0) before it is
    written.

    ``protect_fn`` (when given) marks tags that must survive tag-dropout *and*
    tag-randomization: a tag for which it returns True is always kept verbatim
    even past the @artist prefix. It is still subject to shuffling. Used by the
    colorize prep to keep copyright tags present/intact in every variant.

    Both axes are **prefix-protected**: tag-dropout is the *presence* axis and
    tag-randomize is the *identity* axis, and neither touches the @artist prefix
    (the trigger tag stays intact, only tags *after* ``split_idx`` are
    randomized). Section headers (``On the …`` / ``In the …``) and the sentinel
    are never randomized either.

    ``erasure_pool`` (see :func:`build_erasure_token_pool`) is the source of
    erasure symbols: each randomized slot draws a fresh dual-single vocab token
    (clean one-token in both Qwen3 and T5). It is **required** whenever
    ``tag_randomize_rate > 0`` (no random-ASCII fallback); ignored otherwise.

    **Position clauses are atomic.** A caption carrying the ``…, white socks.
    On the left, blonde hair.`` convention is parsed into its flat bag plus its
    clauses (:mod:`anime_tools.captions.position_clauses`) and each clause is kept
    or dropped *whole* at ``clause_dropout_rate`` (default: ``tag_dropout_rate``),
    with its tags shuffled inside. Per-tag dropout inside a clause would leave a
    half-described position, and — worse — the naive comma split glues the header
    onto the preceding tag (``"white socks. On the left"``), which is what used
    to scatter clause attributes across the whole caption and reassign them to
    the wrong subject.
