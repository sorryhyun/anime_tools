"""Dataset image grouping — connected-components clustering on PE-Spatial grids.

A *curation* primitive (distinct from ``library/preprocess``, which makes data
training-ready): group visually near-identical / same-concept images so the GUI
dataset browser can filter by group, dedup is easy to spot, and subsets are easy
to balance. The grouping edge is the **same near-twin gate the miner uses**
(:mod:`anime_tools.grouping.matching`): two images are connected when a large
*fraction* of their pooled PE-Spatial patch cells find a distinctive mutual
nearest neighbour. A cheap unit-norm CLS-cosine prefilter (``sim_min``) prunes
obviously-unrelated pairs before the dense grid match so the per-artist pass
stays ``O(candidate pairs)`` rather than ``O(n^2)`` grids.

Why grid match, not CLS cosine: a single global CLS descriptor collapses an
image to one vector, so a tight threshold misses near-duplicates that differ in
one region (an edit, a speech bubble) while a loose one merges unrelated images
that share a palette. The cell-level gate (``cell_match_min`` per cell,
``match_frac_min`` fraction of cells) tracks *spatial* overlap, which is what
"these are the same picture" actually means.

Scope is **per-artist**: components are computed independently within each
top-level folder under the source dir (the artist bucket), so two different
artists never merge into one group. The result is a JSON manifest the GUI reads
(plain JSON — no torch — so the GUI stays torch-free).

``connected_components`` is pure (union-find over a precomputed edge list).
``build_groups`` lazily imports the torch-backed embedding + matching
primitives, so importing this module for the pure clustering / manifest schema
stays torch-free.
