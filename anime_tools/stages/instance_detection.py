    instead of box geometry, and unlike the box rule it ships **on** (0.8). The
    box rule is a settled negative because it cannot tell a fragment from a real
    second subject; the mask rule mostly can, and the full candidate ledger
    bears that out — 480 candidates, **7 rows recovered, 2 broken** (the box
    rule's ledger was 2 recovered, 34 broken). Every recovery landed on the
    caption's own girls-count, which is an independent corroboration that the
    merge produced the *right* number and not merely a smaller one. A pair with
    no usable mask falls back to the box rules, so stub detections and part
    boxes are unaffected.

    ``fill_ratio_threshold`` > 0 enables the mask-quality tie-break
    (``docs/experimental/multiview_audit.md`` §5.4 fixed the default at
    2.0): when a candidate collides with a kept box — the pair already judged
    to be the same object — and the candidate's :func:`mask_box_fill` beats the
    kept box's by at least this ratio, the candidate *replaces* the kept box
    instead of being dropped. SAM3's score is box-level confidence and says
    nothing about mask coherence, so a near-empty duplicate can outscore the
    clean mask by a hair and hand every downstream consumer a blank crop.
    Instance count is invariant by construction — the swap only changes which
    of two matched duplicates represents the object. This is deliberately NOT
    an absolute fill gate (settled negative: clean figures live at fill ~0.27);
    the ratio only ever compares the two halves of one matched pair. When
    either mask is missing, the pair falls back to score-only suppression.
